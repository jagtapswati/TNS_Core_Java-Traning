Constructor

A. Need Of Constructor
	variables in the class are called as Data Members
	initially we have to assign values to DM & then we can use it.
	If we do not assign values to Data Members, it will display their default Value.
	int = 0
	float =0. 0
	String = null
	
	to overcome these default values, concept of constructor is used.
	
B. Meaning of Constructor
	class = VAriable(DM) & methods(MF)
	Constructor is one of the special member function in the class
	Constructors are used to assign values to DAta Members

	Constructor are called as special , because
	reason1 : have same name as that of class name
	reason2 : Constructors do not have any return type, even void also
	reason3 : NO need to call constructor manuualy, it get called automatically when we create object of the class. 
C. Two types Of Constructor
	1) Default Constructor - No argument Constructor - no parameters
		drawback - every object get initilized with same value , 
	2) Parametrized Constructor - pass parametrs to constructor
